    <h1>about dylan</h1>

    <p>I am a video gamer and developer from a small (and growing) community in Spartanburg, South Carolina. I love gaming, with my 2 favorite games being ROBLOX and Minecraft. When I’m not active on Discord, I am most likely outside playing with my little brother or learning with the homies at school! I have 2 brothers, one being younger than me and one who is 23 and currently serving in the US Army. I enjoy spending time in the pool, and spend a lot of my summer time in the pool. My favorite sport is Ice Hockey.</p>
